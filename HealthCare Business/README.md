## Project Overview
This project focuses on using SQL to analyze healthcare data, identify trends, and evaluate key metrics. The goal is to derive actionable insights that can improve decision-making in the healthcare sector. The project consists of a series of queries targeting financial risks, patient behaviors, payer contributions, and procedure analysis.

---

## Queries and Objectives

1. **Evaluating Financial Risk by Encounter Outcome**  
   This query analyzes financial risks associated with various encounter outcomes to identify cost patterns and outliers.

2. **Identifying Patients with Frequent High-Cost Encounters**  
   This query focuses on pinpointing patients who frequently incur high costs, aiding in better resource allocation and targeted care.

3. **Identifying Risk Factors Based on Demographics and Encounter Reasons**  
   This query evaluates demographic data and encounter reasons to uncover risk factors for different patient groups.

4. **Assessing Payer Contributions for Different Procedure Types**  
   This query examines payer contributions across various procedures, offering insights into reimbursement patterns.

5. **Identifying Patients with Multiple Procedures Across Encounters**  
   This query tracks patients undergoing multiple procedures over time to assess care efficiency and resource utilization.

6. **Analyzing Patient Encounter Duration for Different Classes**  
   This query investigates the duration of patient encounters categorized by different classes to identify trends and potential bottlenecks.
